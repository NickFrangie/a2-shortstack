## Investment Calculator
This is a basic investment calculator for calculating ROI based on investments' revenue and costs. Flexbox CSS positioning was used for organizing fields, labels, and buttons on the form.

Users can add new entries to the investment table via the **Add Entry** button. Information for these entries must be input via the form prompt that appears after clicking this button before they are saved. Users have the ability to **Delete** or **Edit** entries at any time after they are saved to the server by clicking the related icon.

## Technical Achievements
- **Up-To-Date Single Page App**: This app is single page and provides users the ability to submit investment information while always keeping the client-side up-to-date with that updated server data.
- **Add/Modify/Delete**: Users have the ability to add, modify, and delete investments from the app. The page will remain up-to-date with any of these changes. (This was originally a core requirement, then elevated to a Technical Achievement via the Prof in Discord).
- **Tooltip**: Used a custom-created tooltip to define ROI in the table header.
- **Additional Form Functionality**: Added additional form functionality beyond the requirements of the project, including self-populating the form data for editing entries, and hiding/unhiding the form when the user selects or deselects a entry to be added.
